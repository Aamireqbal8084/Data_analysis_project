1.Project Title: Jharkhand Rainfall & Crop Irrigation Dashboard (2019‚Äì2020)

2.Tool Used: Power BI

3.Domain: Agriculture, Public Sector, Environmental Analytics


4.üß© Project Overview:
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the interrelationship between rainfall patterns, crop irrigation requirements, and climatic conditions in Jharkhand using real-world data from IMD and FAO.

The dashboard helps government planners, policy makers, and agri-business stakeholders make informed decisions regarding:

Efficient water resource allocation,

Crop planning based on water availability,

Identifying surplus/deficit areas for irrigation investment.

5.üìä Key Features & Business Impact:
Rainfall vs. Irrigation Analysis: Identified which crops had water surplus (e.g., Paddy, Arhar) and which needed irrigation (e.g., Potato, Chana), helping to optimize irrigation investments.

District-Wise Water Usage Insights: Showed total water used and recharged per district ‚Äî aiding region-specific water planning.

Crop Production & Revenue Tracking: Compared crop-wise production and potential revenue to guide crop selection and subsidies.

Climate Trend Visualization: Monthly analysis of precipitation, temperature, humidity, and wind helps stakeholders align sowing/harvesting calendars.

Year Comparison (2019 vs 2020): Allows dynamic selection to track changes in rainfall, crop performance, and climatic trends year over year.

6.üîç Data Sources:
India Meteorological Department (IMD)

FAO Crop Guidelines

Public agricultural and weather datasets

7.‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated:
Power BI DAX, filters, slicers, bookmarks, page navigation

Data cleaning, modeling, and visual storytelling

Real-world impact analysis beyond traditional business use cases.
